Length function
instr();
it is used to find the postion of the string

select instr('hariharan.arumugam@bcdtravel.com,'r',2)from dual;

select instr('hariharan.arumugam@bcdtravel.com,'a',6)=8

substr();
it is used to  find the piece of characrers in the string in a string


insert into tablename values('$id','&name','&location';
dual table is empt table which contains only one row

by using sub string we can get a substring of a string or piece of characters of a string;
select substr(hariharan.arumugam@bcdtravel.com,4,5) from dual;
ihara

decode function
by using decode function we can decode the values one format to another format;
or short format to long format or long format to short format;

ASCI FUNCTIONS RETURNS ASCI VALUES OF THE CHARACTERS
SELECT ASCI(CHARACTER FROM THE DUAL;


AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
COUNT()
SUM()
MIN()
MAX()
ROUND()
AVG()

select count(empno)as tot_emp,sum(sal) as total_sal,max(sal) as high_sal,min(sal) as lowest_sal,avg(sal) as average_sal from emp;

select sysdate from dual;
select sysdate-1 from dual;
select sysdate +1 from dual;

to_char is used to convert number to character formate

select to_char(sysdate,'dd-mm-yy') from dual; 10-01-22
select to_char(sysdate,'dd-mm-yyyy') from dual;10-01-2022
select to_char(sysdate,'dd-mom-yyyy') from dual;10-jan-2022
select to_char(sysdate,'dd-month-yyyy') from dual;10-january-2022
select to_char(sysdate,'dd/month/yyyy') from dual; 10/january/2022
select to_char(sysdate,'day dd month yyyy hh:mi:ss') from dual;

By using add month we can add the month from the current month or subract from the current month


select add_month( sysdate,1)from dual;07-12-2022
select add_month(sysdate,-1) from dual;07-10-2022
select month_between('07-nov-2022','07-feb-2022')from dual;
select last_day('04-feb-2022') from dual;
select next_day('04-jan-2022')from dual;
select to_char(sysdate,'yyyy')-to_char('hiredate',yyyy)from emp;
select to_char(sysdate,yyyy)-to_char('hiredate''yyyy')from emp;to find the experience of the employee;
select to_char(sysdate,yyyy)-to_char(hiredate,yyyy)as experience from emp;
distinct clause used to remove duplicates from the result set
this can be used only with select statement;
select distinct(job) from emp;
order by clause used to sorts the records in the result sets;
select * from emp order by sal desc;

condtional operaters
and or not between
set operaters
union union all minus between and like
when the two condition or true we use and condition;
when any of the one condition is true among the condtions this will  execute .

set operators 
union union all minus intesect

constraints:
   
not null-not column enforce a column to not accept the null values   create table hari (id varchar2(10) unique,name) insert into  values('','haran')
unique-  
Primary constraint
foreign key or reference
check


joins-combines two or more row from different tables by refering the relatinship between the colum of the tables;
types of joins
equal joins or simple joins
Self joins
non equii joins
cross joins or cartetion joins
left outer joins 
Right outer joins

select E.empid,E.ename,e.sal,e.deptno,d.dname,d.location from emp e,dept d where e.deptno=d.deptno;
select empid,ename,sal,e.deptno,d.dname,d.location from emp E,dept D where e.Deptno=d.deptno;

Cartesion join
when we write a join quert without join conditon is called cartesion join 
when we write a join query with out join condition is called cartesion joins
it will produce rows which combaines each rows from the  first table with each row.
select * from emp1,dept;

self join
self join compares two different column with in the table and compares the rows 
select * from MHR;
select * from mhr m;
select * from MHR H;
select M.ENO,M.name as employee,H.MHR from MHR M,MHR H  where m.mhr=h.mhr;
 Left outer joins
It returns all the values from left table even though there is no  matches in the right table;
select e.emp,e.ename,e.sal,e.deptno,d.dname,d.loc from emp E,dept D where E.deptno=D.deptno(+);
select e.emp,e.ename,e.sal,e.mgr,d.dname,d,loc from emp e,left outer join dept d where e.deptno=d.deptno;

Types of analatical functions
Rank()
Dense Rank();
select empno,ename,job,sal,rank() over(order by sal desc)as emp_rank from emp;
select empno,ename,job,sal,rank() over(order by sal desc) as emp_rank from emp;

pseudocolumn

select empno,ename,sal from emp where sal=(select max(sal) from emp where sal<(select Max(sal) from emp); 
select * from emp where (source table all column name) not  in (select * from target table name);
select * from emp where (source table all the column name) not in (select * from target table name);
select * from emp where (pk coulmn) not in (select FK column from target table name);
